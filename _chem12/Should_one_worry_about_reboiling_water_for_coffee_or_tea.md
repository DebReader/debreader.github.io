coffee or tea? 

  An article is circulating on the internet about the dangers of
reboiling water and concentrating dissolved chemicals. It amounts to
baseless fear-mongering. Lets consider fluoride as an example. Suppose
you put a liter of water containing 1 ppm fluoride in a kettle and boil
it. You then take 200 mL to make a cup of coffee or tea. That means you
will ingest 0.2 mg of fluoride. If you now let the water keep boiling
until 100 mL evaporates…which would take a long time…and you take
200 mL from the remaining water to make your next cup of coffee, you
will be ingesting 0.22 mg of fluoride. This is an insignificant
difference, even if there were an issue with that amount of fluoride,
which there isn’t. The same argument applies to any other solutes in
water. To imply that making your next cup of coffee from boiled water is
going to have any sort of impact on health is absolute nonsense. With
tea there may actually be a slight difference but that has nothing to do
with taste not toxicity. Boiling drives oxygen out of the water and
deoxygenated water tends to taste more flat.
